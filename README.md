# Huffman Tree Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Huffman Tree data structure using C#. The Huffman Tree is a widely used algorithm for data compression and decompression.

## Description

The Huffman Tree Implementation repository provides a C# implementation of the Huffman Tree algorithm. The algorithm allows for efficient encoding and decoding of data using variable-length codes.

## Features

- Build a Huffman Tree from input data.
- Encode data using the generated Huffman Tree.
- Decode encoded data back to its original form.
- Calculate compression ratio and efficiency.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ilia-Abolhasani/huffman.git
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

## Usage

To use the Huffman Tree implementation, follow these steps:

1. Run the application from your IDE or build an executable file.

2. Use the provided methods to build the Huffman Tree and perform encoding and decoding operations.

   ```csharp
   // Example code for building the Huffman Tree
   string data = "Hello, World!";
   HuffmanTree tree = new HuffmanTree(data);

   // Example code for encoding data
   string encodedData = tree.Encode(data);

   // Example code for decoding data
   string decodedData = tree.Decode(encodedData);

Make sure to replace data with the text you want to encode or decode, and encodedData or decodedData with the resulting encoded or decoded data.

3. Customize the implementation to handle different data types or compression strategies, if required.
4. Ensure proper handling of encoded data and use the same Huffman Tree for successful decoding.
5. Review the provided documentation and code comments for more information on using the Huffman Tree implementation.
